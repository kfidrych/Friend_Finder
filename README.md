## About Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a web app that allows the user to input their name and a profile picture, answer a short survey about themselves, and be returned with their most compatible friend from our database of users. 

The user is shown the matched friend's name and photo at the end of the survey. The user's info and survey submissions are then entered into our database for future users to compare their compatibility to!

## Instructions

Friend Finder is very intuitive and easy to use. The user must:

* Enter their Name
* Enter a link to their profile picture
* Answer all 10 survey questions with a rating of 1 - 5 (1 being Strongly Disagree and 5 being Strongly Agree)

Once the user has submitted all the required information and completed the survey, they need only submit the info and Friend Finder will show you your new best friend!
